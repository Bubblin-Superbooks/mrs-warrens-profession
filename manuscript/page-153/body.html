<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>VIVIE. You were certainly quite justified—from the business point of view.</p><p>MRS WARREN. Yes; or any other point of view. What is any respectable girl brought up to do but to catch some rich man’s fancy and get the benefit of his money by marrying him?—as if a marriage ceremony could make any difference in the right or wrong of the thing! Oh, the hypocrisy of the world makes me sick!

[With great energy] I despise such people: theyve no character; and if theres a thing I hate in a woman, it’s want of character.</p><p>VIVIE. Come now, mother: frankly! Isn’t it part of what you call character in a woman that she should greatly dislike such a way of making money?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">MRS WARREN. Why, of course. Everybody</p></div> </div>
