<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>VIVIE. Yes.</p><p>FRANK. That revelation was supposed to bring about a complete change in the nature of our feeling for one another. It placed us on the footing of brother and sister.</p><p>VIVIE. Yes.</p><p>FRANK. Have you ever had a brother?</p><p>VIVIE. No.</p><p>FRANK. Then you don’t know what being brother and sister feels like? Now I have lots of sisters; and the fraternal feeling is quite familiar to me. I assure you my feeling for you is not the least in the world like it. The girls will go <em>their</em> way; I will go mine; and we shan’t care if we never see one another again. Thats brother and sister. But as to you, I can’t be easy if I have to pass a week without seeing you. Thats not brother and sister. Its exactly what I felt an hour before Crofts made his revelation. In short, dear Viv, it’s love’s young dream.</p></div> </div>
