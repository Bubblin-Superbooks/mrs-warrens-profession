[still holding the gate for Crofts, who loafs through it, heavily bored] You look well everywhere, Mrs Warren.</p><p>FRANK. Bravo, gov’nor! Now look here: lets have a treat before lunch. First lets see the church. Everyone has to do that. It’s a regular old thirteenth century church, you know: the gov’nor’s ever so fond of it, because he got up a restoration fund and had it completely rebuilt six years ago. Praed will be able to shew its points.</p><p>PRAED [rising] Certainly, if the restoration has left any to shew.</p><p>REV. S. [mooning hospitably at them] I shall be pleased, I’m sure, if Sir George and Mrs Warren really care about it.</p></div> </div>
