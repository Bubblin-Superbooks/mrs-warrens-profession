Surely it is you who are a little old fashioned in your prejudices, Miss Warren. I feel bound to tell you, speaking as an artist, and believing that the most intimate human relationships are far beyond and above the scope of the law, that though I know that your mother is an unmarried woman, I do not respect her the less on that account. I respect her more.</p><p>FRANK [airily] Hear! hear!</p><p>VIVIE [staring at him] Is that <em>all</em> you know?</p><p>PRAED. Certainly that is all.</p><p>VIVIE. Then you neither of you know anything. Your guesses are innocence itself compared with the truth.</p><p>PRAED [rising, startled and indignant, and preserving his politeness with an effort] I hope not. [More emphatically] I hope not, Miss Warren.</p></div> </div>
