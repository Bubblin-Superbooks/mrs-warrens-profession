Do you hear? I won’t have it.</p><p>FRANK [quite unabashed] My dear Mrs Warren: don’t you be alarmed. My intentions are honorable: ever so honorable; and your little girl is jolly well able to take care of herself. She don’t need looking after half so much as her mother. She ain’t so handsome, you know.</p><p>MRS WARREN [taken aback by his assurance] Well, you have got a nice healthy two inches of cheek all over you. I don’t know where you got it. Not from your father, anyhow.</p><p>CROFTS [in the garden] The gipsies, I suppose?</p><p>REV. S. [replying] The broomsquires are far worse.</p><p>MRS WARREN [to Frank] S-sh! Remember! you’ve had your warning.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">[Crofts and the Reverend Samuel Gardner come in</p></div> </div>
